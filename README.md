## Description
        
An application that takes user input in order to generate a README file for your project. I think of a README like a recipe for a dish you are making at home. \n ü•ûüîñ üçùüîñüîñ.  Good recipes allow you to gauge what ingredients you need, how much time you should spent, and give access to other sources or content with more information if desired. And I believe the urgency that the universally given default name for JavaScript users -  **README** - elicits shows why these files should be quick and engaging!
## Installation
        
Before generating your README file, you will need to have VS Code, GitBash, and Node.js installed locally (on your computer or remote device).
## Usage
        
To initialize the project, you will copy the Code associated with this GitHub repository and clone the link locally into your desired directory by entering ‚Äògit clone <url>‚Äô into the command-line (aka Terminal for MacOs). Then you will have to install Node Package Manager using 'npm init -y' and finally use the command-line to install the inquirer package by entering 'npm install inquirer'.
## Contributions
        
As developers, each project is its own journey of frustrating attempts, learning lessons, and great personal successes and advancements we often feel connected to. Take pride in your work, and feel confident that you are receiving credit for the amazing efforts you have put into each project. Whether you commit to a project‚Äôs GitHub pages branch, open an issue, or make a Pull request‚Ä¶ these all count as Contributions.
## Tests
